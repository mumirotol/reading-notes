**Introduction**
>Fun fact ... Did you know lemons are man-made? They're actually a cross between a bitter orange and citron. So… so technically we gave lemons to life… or life to lemons

HI, I am Jarely Ramos, a junior attending Legacy Preparatory Charter Academy Mesquite West taking this course in my Web Technologies class. I think technology is incredibly interesting, especially what it takes for it to be made. I questioned these things from a young age and am glad I am closer to understanding the nitty gritty of it. I hope to learn more from this course both for personal projects and for my future!

**What is a _"growth mindset?"_**
A growth mindset is one where people believe any skill can be achieved through dedication, hardwork, and practice. Rather than leaving it to natural selection, they typically hone a love for learning and reaching out of their comfort zone in order to learn something new. 

**How do I remind myself to keep a _"growth mindset?"_**
I've recently tried implementing a growth mindset in my highschool years compared to early elementary and middle school. Whenever I find myself struggling, I remind myself that everything takes practice and time, not everything is perfected straight away. Sometimes, if what I am doing burns me out enough, I find myself taking a break but remind myself that I won't abandon it, that practice makes *perfect.* Lastly, I constantly practice and try to keep myself in check, especially if it's school related. While I tend to procrastinate, I try my best to make time for practicing whatever I am struggling with and reminding myself **"I am doing this for a _reason._"**
